My idea is to build a mobile app that allows the vehicle owner to know timely information about the services done.
In this app, the owner gets to know when the last time service had done.
Based on input received the app should detect what other parameters need service,what parts need replacement.
The app can also use augumented reality(AR) to help owners understand functionality of their vehicle by simply hovering their phone camera over different various buttons of interior of parts in the engine bay
